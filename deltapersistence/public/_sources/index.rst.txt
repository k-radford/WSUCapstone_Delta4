This package implements the persistent homology code from the NSF-DELTA project.

Overview
========

The project "Descriptors of Energy Landscapes using Topological Data Analysis" (DELTA) seeks to use topological data analysis to study the energy landscapes of chemical systems.
This package contains sourcecode used by the team at Colorado State University for analysis of energy landscapes of alkane molecules.
The base persistent homology computations are performed by the GUDHI package.
This package currently contains three modules which supplement the base GUDHI modules.

* Alkane Energy - provides methods for computing the energy landscapes of n-alkane series.
* Sublevel Persistence - provides general methods for computing sublevel set persistent homology.
* Data Utilities - provides methods for converting data to formats usable by GUDHI and for working with GUDHI output.

Getting started
===============

First, the GUDHI library and several other scientific packages for python need to be installed.
This is easiest if using conda/anaconda.
Here is a minimal installation procedure for GUDHI:

Create a clean python 3.8 environment, here called "deltagudhi", though the name is flexible::

    conda create --name deltagudhi python=3.8

Make that the active environment::

    conda activate deltagudhi

List all the installed packages::

    conda list

At this point there should be basically nothing there. Next, install numpy and matplotlib, which are strict required for both GUDHI and this package::

    conda install numpy
    conda install matplotlib

Answer yes to any prompts to install other dependencies.
Install GUDHI from the conda-forge repository::

    conda install -c conda-forge gudhi

To check that everything works, start python::

    python3

Once in python, try importing gudhi::

    import gudhi

If everything went correctly the cursor should advance to the next line in the python interpreter with no output. To double-check, run::

    print(gudhi.__debug_info__)

The output should look something like this::

    Pybind11 version 2.5.0
    Python version 3.8.2
    Cython version 0.29.18
    Numpy version 1.14.6
    Eigen3 version 3.3.7
    CGAL header only version 5.00.1.100
    GMP_LIBRARIES = /opt/anaconda2/envs/marktest/lib/libgmp.dylib
    GMPXX_LIBRARIES = /opt/anaconda2/envs/marktest/lib/libgmpxx.dylib
    MPFR_LIBRARIES = /opt/anaconda2/envs/marktest/lib/libmpfr.dylib

At this point GUDHI is installed.
To use this package, download/clone the repository and navigate to the folder `deltapersistence/deltapersistence/`.
Run some basic tests to verify that everything works.
In detail, at the command prompt, run::

    python3 persistence_script.py --carbons 5 --disp

This should produce the persistence intervals for the energy landscape of pentane (the n-alkane with 5 carbon atoms).
Run::

    python3 persistence_script.py -f ../tests/cube.txt -t cube --bars

This should generate the bars for pentane, now using the detailed formula which accounts for non-bonded interactions. (This is the energy landscape saved as a cubical complex in `cube.txt`.)
Run::

    python3 persistence_script.py -f ../tests/mesh.npy -t mesh --diagram

This should generate the persistence diagram for hexane from the energy landscape saved as `mesh.npy`. It will take a few moments.
Finally, run::

    python3 persistence_script.py --help

This shows all available options.
Experiment with some of them!

Assuming that all goes well, the package can be installed for system-wide access.
To do this, navigate to the folder `deltapersistence` (not the subfolder with the same name), then run::

    pip install .

Doing so allows you to import `deltapersistence` and its provided modules while working in any folder on your system.
It also installs the script `persistence_script.py` as a command-line utility which can be run from anywhere by calling `persistence_script`.

If you need capabilities beyond those accessible from `persistence_script.py` you can look at the detailed documentation of the modules :doc:`alkaneenergy`, :doc:`sublevelpersistence`, and :doc:`datautils`.
